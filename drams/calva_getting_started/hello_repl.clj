(ns hello-repl)

;; Welcome to the Getting Started REPL!
;; There are three files for you to explore. For
;; everyone new to Calva:
;; 1. hello_repl.clj (this file)
;; 2. hello_paredit.clj (intro to structural editing)
;; If you are new to Clojure:
;; 3. welcome_to_clojure.clj (a Beginner's Clojure Guide)

;; Please don't worry if you don't understand the code 
;; in the first two files. They are short and made so 
;; that you can just follow along without the actual
;; code making sense yet. Things will clear up once 
;; you have dug into the Clojure Guide.

;; About commands and shortcuts:
;; Please read https://calva.io/finding-commands/
;; (It's very short.)
;; When we refer to commands by their name, use
;; the VS Code Command Palette to search for them
;; if you don't know the keyboard shortcut.
;; All Calva commands are prefixed with ‚ÄùCalva‚Äù.

;; == Evaluating definitions ==
;; Alt+Enter is the Calva default keyboard shortcut
;; to evaluate the current ‚Äùtop level‚Äù forms. Top
;; level meaning the outermost ‚Äùcontainer‚Äù of forms, 
;; which is the file. Place the cursor anywhere
;; inside this function to give it a try.

(defn greet
  "I'll greet you"
  [s]
  (str "Hello " s "!"))

;; Forms inside `(comment ...)` are also considered
;; to be top level. This makes it easy to experiment
;; with code.

(comment
  (greet "World"))

;; You should see "Hello World!" displayed inline,
;; and also printed to the `output.calva-repl` editor,
;; aka ‚ÄùThe Output Window‚Äù, aka ‚ÄùThe REPL Window‚Äù.
;; To clear inline results display, press `ESC`.

;; Anything printed to stdout is not shown inline.

(comment
  (println (greet "World")))

;; You should see the result of the evaluation, nil,
;; inline, and ‚ÄùHello World!‚Äù followed by the result
;; printed to the output window.

;; == Evaluating the Current Form ==
;; Ctrl+Enter evaluates the ‚Äùcurrent‚Äù form
;; Try with the cursor at different places in this
;; code snippet:

(comment
  (def foo
    [1 2 "three four"]))

;; You might discover that Calva regards words in
;; strings as forms. Don't panic if `three` causes
;; an evaluation error. It is not defined, since
;; it shouldn't be. You can define it, of course,
;; just for fun and learning: Top level eval these 

(comment
  (def three 3)
  (def four "four"))

;; Then eval current form inside the string above
;; Calva sends to the REPL whatever you ask it send.

;; == Evaluating in Threaded Expressions
;; Ctrl+Alt+Enter will evaluate the current enclosing
;; form up to the cursor. Useful in threaded
;; expressions. Say you want to calculate the average
;; ratings for the data below:

(comment
  ;; First you need to top-level evaluate this
  (def colt-express
    {:name "Colt Express"
     :categories ["Family"
                  "Strategy"]
     :play-time 40
     :ratings {:pez 5.0
               :kat 5.0
               :wiw 5.0
               :vig 3.0
               :rex 5.0
               :lun 4.0}})

  ;; And this
  (defn average [coll]
    (/ (apply + coll) (count coll)))

  ;; This too, if you like
  (->> colt-express
       :ratings
       vals
       average)
  ;; To see the result at each step in the thread
  ;; You can also Ctrl+Alt+Enter after each form.
  ;; Place the cursor after `(->> colt-express` and
  ;; try it. Then after `:ratings`, and after `vals`.
  )

;; == Evaluating Top Level Form to Cursor
;; Shift+Alt+Enter will evaluate all code from
;; the start of the current top level form, up until
;; the cursor, with all open brackets closed.
;; Try it by repeating the above example, but start
;; with placing the cursor at, say, right behind
;; `:wiw 5.0`, then evaluating top level to cursor.

(comment
  ;; The command is useful when evaluating a block of
  ;; code up to a point. You might for instance wrap
  ;; some code in a `(do ...)` and then use the
  ;; *Evaluate From Start of Top Level Form to Cursor*
  ;; command at different places to examine the code.
  ;; Try it at the numbered line comment below.
  (do
    (def bar-express
      {:name "Bar Express"
       :categories ["Family"
                    "Strategy"]
       :play-time 40
       :ratings {:pez 5.0
                 :kat 5.0
                 :wiw 5.0   ; 1, then eval `bar-express`
                 :vig 3.0
                 :rex 5.0
                 :lun 4.0}})

    (defn average [coll]
      (/ (apply + coll) (count coll)))

    (let [foo-express (-> bar-express
                          (assoc :name "Foo Express")
                          (assoc-in [:ratings :lyr] 5.0)
                          (update-in [:ratings :vig] inc))]
      (->> foo-express   ; 2
           :ratings      ; 3
           vals          ; 4
           average       ; 5
           ))))

;; == Rich Comments Support ==
;; Repeating an important concept: Forms inside
;; `(comment ...)` are also considered top level
;; by Calva. Alt+Enter at different places below
;; to get a feel for it.

(comment
  "I ‚ô•Ô∏è Clojure"
  (greet "World")
  foo

  ;; Also try the commands *Show Hover*,
  ;; *Show Definition Preview Hover*
  ;; *Go to Definition*  

  (println (greet "side effect"))
  (+ (* 2 2)
     2)

  ;; Here too, if you have Java sources installed

  (Math/abs -1)
  (greet "Calva REPL")
  (range 10))

;; Google Rich Comments, if you are new
;; to this style of coding.

;; == You Control what is Evaluated ==
;; Please note that Calva never evaluates your code
;; unless you explicitly ask for it. So, except for
;; this file, you will have to load files you open
;; yourself. Make it a habit to do this, because
;; sometimes things don't work in peculiar ways when
;; your file is not loaded.
;; Try with this file: `Ctrl+Alt+C Enter`.

;; Also, once you have evaluated a form and then
;; update it. Calva will not automatically evaluate
;; the new code, or code depending on it.

;; == The Calva Debugger ==
;; https://calva.io/debugger/
;; The easiest way to use it is to
;; instrument a function for debugging. You do that
;; by having the cursor in the function and then 
;; use the command:
;; *Instrument Current Top Level Form for Debugging*
;; Then you call the function. This will cause the
;; debugger to stop at the first breakable point in
;; the instrumented function

(comment
  ;; Let's try it without instrumentation first. This
  ;; function has a bug. Evaluate it the usual way
  ;; (`Alt+Enter`) first and then call it.

  (defn bar
    [n]
    (cond (> n 40) (+ n 20)
          (> n 20) (- (first n) 20)
          :else 0))

  (bar 2)  ; works
  (bar 24) ; throws, what's going on?

  ;; That's a strange error message (maybe you say,
  ;; depending on how familiar you are with Clojure).
  ;; Now instrument the function as described above.
  ;; Calva will indicate code that is instrumented for
  ;; debugging. Now evaluate the problematic function
  ;; call. The debugger will start and wait for you
  ;; to step through the function.
  ;;
  ;; PLEASE NOTE: There is currently a bug making this
  ;; stepping less convenient than it should be, you
  ;; will need to select the top stack frame in order
  ;; to step. See:
  ;; https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva/issues/1210
  ;;
  ;; To un-instrument the function, just evaluate it
  ;; the normal way (top level evaluation).
  ;; Debugger docs here: https://calva.io/debugger/

  ;; NB: If you are new to Clojure you might find some
  ;; familiarity noting that Calva has a debugger.
  ;; However, try exploring Interactive Programming,
  ;; using the REPL first. That's the Clojure Way.
  ;; This section is here for you to get aware that
  ;; the debugger exists, for those rare occasions
  ;; when it is actually needed.
  )

;; == Stopping Infinite Loops ==
;; Since evaluating Clojure expressions is so
;; easy and fun, sometimes you happen to evaluate
;; something that never finishes, or takes too long
;; to finish. For this, Calva has a command named
;; *Interrupt Running Evaluations*. You will need
;; it if you top-level evaluate this:

(comment
  (def tmp1 (dorun (range))))

;; == Editing Code ==
;; A note about editing Clojure in Calva:
;; If you edit and experiment with the examples
;; you will notice that Calva auto-indents your
;; code. You can re-indent, and format, code at
;; will, using the `Tab` key.

;; There is also some help with writing blocks of
;; line comments (like this one).
;; Alt+Enter with the cursor in a line comment
;; will ‚Äùcontinue‚Äù the comment on next line.
;; Try it, why don't ya! üòé
;; 
;; There is some extra help given when Calva thinks
;; you are typing a bulleted or numbered list.
;; 
;; * foo
;; * bar
;; 
;; 1. CIDER 
;; 2. Cursive

;; === More about editing ===
;; Please continue to `hello_paredit.clj` to learn
;; the very basics of structural editing in Calva.
;; Here's maybe the most important thing from that
;; guide: _Paredit strict mode is active by default_ 
;; It will help you to not delete brackets that
;; would break the structure of the code.
;; Use Alt+Backspace to override.

(comment
  (defn strict-greet
    "Try to remove brackets and string quotes
   using Backspace or Delete. Try the same
   with the Alt key pressed."
    [name]
    (str "Strictly yours, " name "!"))
  
  (strict-greet "dear Paredit fan"))

;; (Restore with *Undo* if needed.)

;; Done? Awesome. Please consider to familiarize
;; yourself more with Paredit using the interactive
;; guide. If you are new to Clojure, please
;; continue with `hello_clojure.clj`, which is an
;; interactive guide to the Clojure language.

;; Have a Clojure project you want to get hook
;; Calva up to? See: https://calva.io/connect/
