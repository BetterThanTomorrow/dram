# A Mini shadow-cljs Fullstack App

This project mainly sets up the very tiny [shadow-cljs](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs) fullstack starter project as described in [Fullstack Workflow with shadow-cljs
](https://code.thheller.com/blog/shadow-cljs/2024/10/18/fullstack-cljs-workflow-with-shadow-cljs.html) by [Thomas Heller](https://github.com/thheller). You should probably read that article!

## Usage

You can copy the project from this repository, but it is mainly intended to be created and started by [Calva](https://calva.io), using the command:
* **Calva: Open the REPL Menu (Start/Connect a REPL, etc.)**.
* Then select **Create a mini shadow.cljs Fullstack project**.

The project will be created and opened and started. Give it some little time and you should then be able to open the app which will be served on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Conveniences

* The project will automatically start the REPL, the server, and the shadow-cljs watcher, whenever you open the project folder in VS Code. You can adjust this behaviour from [the workspace settings file](.vscode/settings.json)
* We use [clj-reload](https://github.com/tonsky/clj-reload) to reload updated Clojure (shadow-cljs reloads the ClojureScript code).
* There is a custom Calva REPL command added that will reload updated Clojure code and restart the server. Bring up the custom commands menu with `ctrl+alt+space space`. But you can also define a regular keybinding for this, like so:
  ```json
  {
    "key": "ctrl+alt+r r",
    "when": "calva:connected",
    "command": "calva.runCustomREPLCommand",
    "args": {
      "snippet": "(require 'repl) (repl/restart!)",
      "repl": "clj"
    }
  },
  ```

## Requirements

Java. In fact **Java is the _only_ requirement**, if you are using Calva.

For minimal requirements this project does not use NPM, and instead relies on [deps.edn/tools.deps](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli) (the `clojure` CLI tool). Since Calva has the deps.edn tool built in, you don't need to install it separately to use this project. (But you are highly recommended to install it anyway, eventually you are going to need it.)

## Differences from Thomas Heller's setup

The project differes only slightly from what is described in [Fullstack Workflow with shadow-cljs](https://code.thheller.com/blog/shadow-cljs/2024/10/18/fullstack-cljs-workflow-with-shadow-cljs.html):

* In the original the project REPL is started with `clj -M -m shadow.cljs.devtools.cli clj-repl`, but that doesn't start nrepl with the middleware that Calva wants. Because of this, this project relies on Calva's shadow-cljs REPL start facilities instead.
  * And thus, in [repl/start!](src/dev/repl.clj) we don't start the shadow watcher.
* In [app.cljs](src/main/acme/frontend/app.cljs) the `:dev/after-load` hook is added for hot reloading to be enabled out of the box.
  * We also make the app do something to the web page it is running in.
* In [shadow-cljs.edn](shadow-cljs.edn) the `:frontend` build has
  * a `:devtools` entry and used to enable hot reloading of css.
  * `:output-dir` and `:output-dir` entries are added. (These can be a bit tricky to get right when starting with shadow-cljs, is my experience.)
* In [deps.edn](deps.edn) we add an explicit dependency on version 1.12 of [Clojure](https://clojure.org). So that we know `add-libs` is available with fewer REPL restarts needed.
* As described in [Conveniences](#conveniences) above, the project uses [clj-reload](https://github.com/tonsky/clj-reload) for reloading of Clojure code.
